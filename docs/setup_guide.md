# Setup Guide

## Clone git repository
The first thing you will need to do is to install the GitHub repository which can be found here. To clone it into your machine follow the steps described in [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) according to your operating system and your GitHub version.

## Dependencies

### Docker
To run the project it is required to install Docker. To do so follow the instructions available on the following pages according to your operating system:
